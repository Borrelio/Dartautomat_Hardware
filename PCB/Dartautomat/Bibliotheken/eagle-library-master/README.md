# FluorumLabs / Eagle Library
This repository contains the part library for FluorumLabs projects. It is not that extensive like other libraries you can find on internet and it contains only those parts, which I am using or planning to use, or, sometimes, just have in stock.

There are three main features of this library:
- It contains "invisible" components like LED stand-offs or potentiometer knobs (this makes BOM creation a lot easier)
- The footprints are well-tested
- There are (preferred) Mouser partnumbers for the most parts in the 'MOUSER' attribute.
